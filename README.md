# User Management App

This project is a React-based user management application that interacts with the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to simulate CRUD operations. The application is designed to display, add, edit, and delete user records in a paginated table.

---

## Features

1. *Fetching Users*: Displays a list of users fetched from the API.
2. *Adding Users*: A form to add new users.
3. *Editing Users*: Allows editing existing user details.
4. *Deleting Users*: Deletes a user from the list.
5. *Error Handling*: Displays user-friendly error messages.
6. *Pagination*: Handles large datasets by paginating users.
7. *Client-side Validation*: Validates form inputs before submission.
8. *Responsive UI*: Built with Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly design.

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

## Challenges Faced

1. *API Limitations*:
   - The JSONPlaceholder API does not persist data, making it challenging to verify data consistency after CRUD operations. To address this, operations like POST, PUT, and DELETE were simulated by updating the local state.

2. *Form Validation*:
   - Ensuring that the form inputs were validated without over-complicating the logic. This was solved by adding client-side validation logic in the UserForm component.

3. *Pagination Logic*:
   - Handling pagination in the state while ensuring smooth navigation between pages.

4. *Error Handling*:
   - Displaying appropriate error messages to the user in case of network or API failures.

---

## Potential Improvements

1. *Persistent Backend*:
   - Integrate with a real backend to persist changes across sessions.

2. *Styling Enhancements*:
   - Replace Bootstrap with a custom design system or a modern library like Tailwind CSS for more flexibility.

3. *State Management*:
   - Use a state management library like Redux or Context API to manage complex state more efficiently.

4. *Testing*:
   - Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code reliability.

5. *Error Boundary*:
   - Implement a global error boundary to handle unexpected runtime errors.

6. *Accessibility Improvements*:
   - Ensure all components meet WCAG accessibility guidelines.

## Author

Developed by Balusu Satya Venkata Vignesh. Feel free to reach out for any questions or feedback!# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
